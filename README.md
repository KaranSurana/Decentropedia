# Decentropedia

## A Blockchain Based Enclyclopedia

<br>

- Summary
<hr>

Using a collaborative approach, we have proposed the concept of a decentralized system for hosting large-scale websites like Wikipedia. Wikipedia's scalability concerns are attributed to centralized page administration. Our technology decentralizes this capability by spreading the pages over a network of computers. In comparison to Wikipedia, which is prone to incorrect modifications, Decentropedia's pages are immutable.

- Future Scope
<hr>

Wikipedia has demonstrated its incapacity to collect any of the monetary and inherent worth of material provided by its platform and community. In this sense, there is opportunity to radically disrupt the existing quo by developing distributed knowledge base with technology that records and returns community value creation to the platform's authors, curators, and developers. Furthermore, a distributed platform that pulls consensus, contributions, incentives, and value from the network's participants offers the members a unique chance to participate in the network's real hosting, storage, and distribution of material.
